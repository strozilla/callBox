# CallBox assinment

I used a combination of html, css and javascript to build/design several components.

## Employee List

The first is a list of employees by department. I added a little extra style by making each department collapsible.

### Cadillac Slide

Instead of just making one slide, I made a 3 card slideshow.

#### Simple Nav

Just a simple responsive navbar with a dropdown menu.

##### BONUS

I used the filter method. Which iterates through each 'element' of array_one and array_two and outputs the same elements.
